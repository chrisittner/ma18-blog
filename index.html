      <p>This week I have registered my MA thesis in Philosophy, titled "Inferentialism and Inductive Definitions".
On this page I collect references, additional material, and ideas.
I am using a blog instead of a LaTex file for this collection, as a reminder for myself not to resort to 'academic' or dense prose.</p>

      <p>The first step when introducing a formal language is to define its alphabet &amp; grammar (syntax). 
Which symbols are part of the language? 
How are the words and sentences (aka formulas, expressions) of the language formed?
Next, one has to explain <em>how the language is to be understood</em>. 
<em>What do the words and sentences mean?</em> 
 How should we interpret them?
The study of meaning is <em>semantics</em>. </p>
<p>The approach to semantics used in my thesis, <em>(Logical) Inferentialism</em> (also called <em>proof-theoretic semantics</em>), is a non-standard account of meaning for formal languages. It makes sense to first recall the received approach, for pointing out essential differences. The standard approach to semantics in logic is to identify the meaning of a sentence with its <em>truth conditions</em>, thereby reducing sentence-meaning to the notion of truth. To be aware what a sentence means is to know the conditions under which the sentence would be true. Following Tarski, truth is analyzed as <em>truth in a model</em>.
This received approach is so ubiquitous nowadays, that 'to give a semantics' usually just means to give a basic model theory for the language in question.</p>
<p>We briefly outline the usual semantics for formal logic and point out basic features of this account.
We then compare and contrast this to the operational understanding of the formal languages used for computer programming.</p>
<h3><em>Truth-conditional</em> semantics for sentences:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tarski semantics: Give <em>Model</em>, map words to objects ("meanings", "semantic values"). Sentences are mapped to values <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> by a model (satisfaction relation). <strong>Extensional meaning</strong> = denotation = truth value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kripke semantics: Give set of models, each maps words to objects. Sentences are mapped to subsets of set of models (those in which they are satisfied (=true)). <strong>Intensional meaning</strong> = sense_Fr?  = truth conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sentence-meaning explained in terms of truth. Understand what a sentence means = be aware of the conditions for its truth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Operational</em> semantics?</h3>
<p><em>operational</em> (CS) vs <em>denotational</em> (Logic) semantics.</p>

      <p>The inferentialist account is bites with several orthodoxies in philosophy:
    - Truth as more basic than Proof
    - Truth as bivalent
    - The analysis of logical consequence in terms of truth (necessary truth-preservation)
    - Meaning=truth-conditions
    - yields just intuitionistic logic; inferentialist analysis of truth leave truth as an epistemic notion.
    - Fails to explain the referential/denotational aspect of meaning.</p>

      <p>What restrictions need to be imposed on the rules of a connective for it to be 'meaningful' (= a well-formed definition)?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- GE-Rules (local)
- Conservativeness (global)
- Stability ?
- Normal forms ?
- Monotonicity/strict positivity ?
- ..
- PSH&#39;s &#39;reductive&#39; vs. foundational analysis
</pre></div>


<p>-&gt; Leaves uneasy feeling that doesn't actually work.</p>
<p>But, rather: there are many ways to make it work, but it requires making (philosophically unjustified) choices. No canonical way.</p>
