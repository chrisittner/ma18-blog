This week I have registered my MA thesis in Philosophy, titled "Inferentialism and Inductive Definitions".
On this page I collect references, additional material, and ideas.
I am using a blog instead of a LaTex file for this collection, as a reminder for myself not to resort to 'academic' or dense prose.
