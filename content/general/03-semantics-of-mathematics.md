title: Semantics for Mathematical Language
date: 28.03.2018

Tarski's semantics accounts for the meaning of the logical symbols. It can be extended to account for the meaning of other fragments of language, such as modal vocabulary (using Kripke models) or indexicals.

Similarly, we may wish to provide a semantics for the fragment of language that is **the language of Mathematics**.
