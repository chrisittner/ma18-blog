title: Logical Inferentialism - The Ugly Part
date: 21.03.2018

What restrictions need to be imposed on the rules of a connective for it to be 'meaningful' (= a well-formed definition)?

    - GE-Rules (local)
    - Conservativeness (global)
    - Stability ?
    - Normal forms ?
    - Monotonicity/strict positivity ?
    - ..
    - PSH's 'reductive' vs. foundational analysis

-> Leaves uneasy feeling that doesn't actually work.

But, rather: there are many ways to make it work, but it requires making (philosophically unjustified) choices. No canonical way.
