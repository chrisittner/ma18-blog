title: Logical Inferentialism - The Bad
date: 21.04.2018

The inferentialist account is bites with several orthodoxies in philosophy:
    - Truth as more basic than Proof
    - Truth as bivalent
    - The analysis of logical consequence in terms of truth (necessary truth-preservation)
    - Meaning=truth-conditions
    - yields just intuitionistic logic; inferentialist analysis of truth leave truth as an epistemic notion.
    - Fails to explain the referential/denotational aspect of meaning.
