title: GSoC proposal accepted!
date: 26.04.16

My proposal for [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) has 
been accepted :). This means that I will spend part of my summer working on the [pgmpy](http://pgmpy.org) library. I will implement some techniques for Bayesian Network 
structure learning. You can have a look an my proposal 
[here](http://pgmpy.chrisittner.de/pages/gsoc-proposal.html).

As a first step, I set up this blog to document my progress. It is built with the [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) static-site generator and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Updates will follow!
