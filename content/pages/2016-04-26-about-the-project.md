title: About the Project


pgmpy is a Python library for working with probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian Networks, Markov Network and variants). In the following months, I will extend pgmpy with methods to select Bayesian models based on data sets. I'll first implement support for basic score-based and constraint-based structure learning. Second, I will add common enhancements to the score-based approach, such as local score computation/caching and tabu search. Finally, I will implement the [MMHC](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.106.4729&rep=rep1&type=pdf) algorithm, which combines the score-based and the constraint-based method.


This blog documents my progress in the scope of [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I will post updates on Bayesian Networks, structure learning and on implementation details.
