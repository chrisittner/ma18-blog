title: About Me

I'm a 2nd year MA student at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. In addition, I am currently finishing up a BSc Mathematics at LMU Munich. Apart from my studies, I enjoy hobby electronics and outdoor activities. [This](http://rifug.io/) is where I live. I edit files using [Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk) on [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/).
